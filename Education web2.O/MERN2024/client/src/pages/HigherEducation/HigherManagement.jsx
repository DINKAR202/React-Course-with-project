                  <b>Key Issues</b>
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Many ideas never get the spotlight it deserves because of poor
                  execution. Some crumble even before the execution process
                  begins. Project execution and management require a team
                  effort. But, clients often fail to build a team of
                  professionals that can collectively work and deliver results.
                  Hence, outsourcing project management solutions is a better
                  alternative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, most service providers do not provide full support.
                  Most agencies only offer specialized services, while others
                  only take responsibility for a part of the project. So,
                  finding a full-service project management company is
                  challenging. Even when clients do find one, they might have to
                  deal with some issues later. It may be delayed delivery,
                  hidden costs, unprofessional services by amateurs, and more.
                  Also, many service providers are incapable of dealing with
                  offshore clients or clients across diverse industry sectors.
                  Therefore, choosing the right project management agency is
                  crucial.
